# Cards Against Assembly

## Objective

Let's practice making components! We'll make a component that displays 
the proper number of white answer cards in Cards Against Assembly.

## Provided Code

You already have the CSS styles you will need to get the look and 
feel of Cards Against Humanity provided in style.css.

You already have an index.html which includes a couple hints on how to 
get started. 

You already have a factories.js which includes a bunch of sample cards 
for questions and answers. Be sure and add your own!

## Your goals

* Fill out the cards controller and any helper functions it needs to display a question card
* Create a component for the white answer cards
    * HTML file for displaying the component
    * JS file (angular.component) for logic
    * Include and use the component in index.html

## Stretch goals

* Make the number of players dynamic (within reason of course)
* Make a button that changes turns and generates new cards
* Put in logic so that the same question card never comes up twice
